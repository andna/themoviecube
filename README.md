# The Movie Cube

The app is built with React 18, of course Typescript, Almost full test coverage with Jest, and specifically [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), which lets me manipulate 3d objects,
and even html in 3d easily.

The data is searched in the famouse [The Movie DB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/)
