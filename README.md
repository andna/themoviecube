# Github Logger

Hello Scalio!

I hope you like this [challenge solution](https://github-logger.vercel.app/).

I initially created a simple html form with all the required features, 
but almost immediately I decided to try for a cool *spin* and practice other skills.

The app is built with React 18, of course Typescript, and [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), which lets me manipulate 3d objects,
and even html in 3d easily.

I feel proud of what I accomplished in this week! 

I hope you like it too.
